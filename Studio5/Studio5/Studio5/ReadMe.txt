I chose values 0 and 1 for my two integers. 

H:\332_Local_Repo\332_studios\Studio5\Studio5\Debug>Studio5.exe
mySwap version 1
1
0

I think that now when I run the program, I will see 0 and then 1. I think this is because
I am using pointers now, which are not direct references to the integers. The addresses will change
but the values of the integers will not be swapped. 

Output:

H:\332_Local_Repo\332_studios\Studio5\Studio5\Debug>Studio5.exe
mySwap version 1
1
0

My prediction was wrong. 

Can't run the last overloaded method because there is a mistake I am making when I make it.

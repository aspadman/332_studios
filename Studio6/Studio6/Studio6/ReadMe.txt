Output from testing the squareElement method:

with index 0:

H:\332_Local_Repo\332_studios\Studio6\Studio6\Debug>Studio6.exe
4

with index 1:
H:\332_Local_Repo\332_studios\Studio6\Studio6\Debug>Studio6.exe
9

when trying to call this function with an index that is greater than the size of the vector:

I get the error message that says "debug assertion failed...vector subscript out of range"

I predict that I would get the message saying that the index is out of bounds, but instead
I just got the previous error.
